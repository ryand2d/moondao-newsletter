Congratulations Mooney Hodler! Welcome to the final day of your MoonDAO onboarding series. Youâ€™re no longer just a common Earthling now if youâ€™ve completed your Moon Missions and wrapped up this in-depth onboarding and training.

We have covered a lot during this time and you should have a comprehensive understanding of virtually all the major components of MoonDAO and feel ready to help us achieve our road map to the stars.

Letâ€™s recap a little bit of what weâ€™ve covered over the past week or so:

- [â€‹What is MoonDAO?â€‹](https://docs.moondao.com/mission/) Our mission, values, and road map.
- [â€‹MoonDAOâ€™s rolesâ€‹](https://docs.moondao.com/roles/) and what their functions are: Astronauts, Rocketeers, Moon Settler, Mooney Hodler, and Earthling.
- [â€‹Getting involved in Discordâ€‹](https://www.moondao.com/discord) and attending our weekly events.
- [â€‹MoonDAOâ€™s Constitutionâ€‹](https://docs.moondao.com/constitution/): how it was formed and what it contains.
- The essentials [â€‹MoonDAO's tokensâ€‹](https://docs.moondao.com/token/), [â€‹obtaining vMOONEYâ€‹](https://app.moondao.com/), why we use stake-to-vote, how quadratic voting works, and [â€‹where we vote off-chainâ€‹](https://snapshot.org/#/tomoondao.eth).
- MoonDAOâ€™s history: the meme origins, raising 2,600 ETH on Juicebox, basic tokenomics, selecting our first two astronauts and sending them to space, and what the future might hold.
- Working for MoonDAO: [â€‹getting involved with a guildâ€‹](https://docs.moondao.com/guild-guidelines/), [â€‹completing bounties on Deworkâ€‹](https://app.dework.xyz/moondao), and the basics about [â€‹contributing to a projectâ€‹](https://docs.moondao.com/project-guidelines/) or even leading your own.

And you are now equipped with enough information to make informed decisions about MoonDAO governance if all you want to do is lurk and vote for now, but we hope to see you start playing a more active role.
