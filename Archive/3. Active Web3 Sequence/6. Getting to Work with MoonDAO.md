Hey {{ subscriber.first_name | strip | default: "there" }},

Welcome to Day 6 out of 7 of your MoonDAO onboarding. Last time, we covered MoonDAO‚Äôs history and how we got to where we are today, but the future and where we go depends on the work of contributors like you and what we can accomplish collectively as a DAO. One of the biggest lingering questions you may still have is how you can start working with MoonDAO and contributing your time and energy toward our space mission (while getting compensated, of course!). We reward good ideas, ambitious ideas, and even crazy ideas.

Our community only thrives based on the contributions and work of our members and these opportunities are available to anyone and everyone who has the skills and drive to complete tasks and projects, regardless of nationality or formal credentials.

This is part of the reason we believe a DAO is so powerful for the burgeoning space industry ‚Äì we are opening opportunities to all space enthusiasts to work together even if the country where they live doesn‚Äôt have a space sector. You could be living in the middle of Africa or the middle of nowhere America and still be a valued contributor to MoonDAO so long as you have an Internet connection! It‚Äôs a truly international effort that can unite humanity around a common cause: becoming interplanetary and creating permanent settlements beyond Earth.

There are both big and small ways to contribute according to your availability, meaning we have something for you even if your time is limited due to your current job or if you have the flexibility to devote more energy to our efforts.

NOTE: We do not offer full-time employment in the DAO without having seen proof of work and a record of contributions on other projects. While we support some people full-time, the vast majority of people work at MoonDAO part-time, getting rewarded through bounties or by joining a project. Pay is dependent on the amount of time and energy people put in, as well as peer review by MoonDAO members through [‚ÄãCoordinape gift-giving circles‚Äã](https://docs.moondao.com/project-guidelines/#how-do-project-members-get-rewarded-with-coordinape) at the end of each quarter. Sometimes it can be hard to estimate how much will be received in a gift-giving circle, so we caution people that if they have a family to feed or a mortgage to pay that they do not solely rely on MoonDAO before finding a long-term role in the DAO.

## Projects vs. Guilds

MoonDAO‚Äôs work is organized into two major organizational structures: Projects and Guilds.

Projects are goal-based efforts by a small, dedicated team that have specific end dates and objectives in mind. These projects are non-perpetual and operate with a voter-approved budget that covers project expenses as well as compensation to the team members. All projects must go through the [‚ÄãProject Proposal process‚Äã](https://docs.moondao.com/project-guidelines/) which includes a detailed review by the Senate and a Senate vote before it goes up on [‚ÄãSnapshot‚Äã](https://snapshot.org/#/tomoondao.eth) for final approval by the MoonDAO community.

Guilds are typically lower commitment than projects and are the best place to start as a new member of MoonDAO. Our Guilds are talent pools where we onboard, orient and train members to complete task bounties needed within those larger projects.

While the specific qualifications and requirements of a bounty vary, they are usually smaller tasks that are open to applications or submissions from any member of the community or active members of the associated Guild.

Each Guild has its own focus and our four primary guilds are:

- **GROWTH:** Focused on scaling MoonDAO via marketing, onboarding, and talent outreach.
- **SPACE ENGINEERING:** Made for engineers, researchers, and people deeply embedded in the space industry.
- **WEB DEVELOPMENT:** A home for web-dev and solidity developers to maintain MoonDAO‚Äôs platform and develop new Web3 projects.
- **COMMUNITY:** Focused on operations, community engagement, and maintaining a strong and healthy culture of cooperation at MoonDAO.

[‚ÄãRead our Guild Guidelines‚Äã](https://docs.moondao.com/guild-guidelines/)

## Where to Start?

You can wade into the shallow end of the pool and complete bounties, or you can jump into the deep end and start working on projects (or leading your own, if the community supports it), the choice is up to you and that‚Äôs part of the choose-your-own-adventure nature of a DAO.

Generally speaking, participating in guilds is a great way to get your feet wet, meet fellow members, and start building a portfolio with proof of work which makes it more likely that you‚Äôll be sought out to participate in an upcoming project.

Completing bounties is the main way to contribute to active projects if you weren‚Äôt part of the original team, but if you‚Äôre eager to join a team project directly, then watch the Project Ideation channel in Discord to see if there are ways you could contribute to an upcoming project.

We‚Äôve had new members join and within a month or two they are already leading their own projects as Rocketeers and playing a larger role in governance in the MoonDAO Senate. Can you imagine a similar story playing out at NASA or SpaceX?

A bottom-up, community-led organization like MoonDAO is breaking down the barriers to working in the space industry and the opportunities are there for those who have the initiative, drive, and bring forward ideas or work that their peers value and support.

## üöÄ Today‚Äôs Moon Mission

Your mission today is to get involved with a Guild and explore the tasks and bounties that are currently available ‚Äì doing so will give you a much better idea of what we are working on now and where your skills and talents may be best aligned.

**1. Apply to a Guild**

If you haven‚Äôt done so yet, please fill out the [‚ÄãGuild Onboarding form‚Äã](https://moondao.com/contribute). You can expect to hear back from your Guild Steward soon thereafter who will make sure you are a good fit and help you get started. Ignore this step if you‚Äôve previously completed it.

**2.** [‚Äã**Explore Bounties on Dework**‚Äã](https://app.dework.xyz/moondao) Dework is where guilds or individual projects will post tasks and bounties that they are looking for someone to complete. You can [‚Äãjoin MoonDAO‚Äôs Dework‚Äã](https://app.dework.xyz/moondao) by clicking ‚ÄúConnect‚Äù which will sync your profile with Discord for roles and permissions, and then click ‚ÄúFollow‚Äù to stay informed about future opportunities.

Connect and Follow MoonDAO on Dework to complete tasks and earn bounties.

If you‚Äôre ready and there is a suitable task, you may be able to apply to start working straight away. Successfully completing tasks and bounties on Dework is a way to earn MOONEY which will increase your role in the governance decisions of MoonDAO.

Completing bounties will also build a portfolio or record of contributions which will make it easier for you to apply to future tasks not only with MoonDAO but any other DAOs because they can easily see your record of success, increasing work opportunities for you.

While humanity hasn‚Äôt yet entered the age of intergalactic bounty hunters like Boba Fett, you can enter the world of interDAO bounty hunters thanks to your MoonDAO contributions on Dework. It‚Äôs also an exciting platform to see what some of the most impactful DAOs are doing in the age of decentralized work in the Web3 space.

We hope you‚Äôre excited by the opportunities afforded by Web3 because we‚Äôre excited to see you become a driving force in MoonDAO‚Äôs mission to support space exploration, research, and ultimately, a lunar settlement. The Moon parties are going to be unforgettable!
