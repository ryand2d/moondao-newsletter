Welcome, Earthling!

We‚Äôre so excited that you‚Äôve decided to join us on our mission to make space open, accessible, and available to all! We were the first DAO to [‚Äãsend someone into space‚Äã](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXXlSG-du7c) and we have a lot of other interesting projects in the works like a decentralized satellite or brewing space beer! Our mission is to create a self-sustaining, self-governing colony on the Moon to act as a launch point for humanity to explore the cosmos!

Yes, we‚Äôre serious.

We are living in a new golden age of space exploration and we strongly believe that this realm shouldn‚Äôt be something available exclusively to the ultra-rich or well-connected.

This is where MoonDAO can thrive: we believe that an international, decentralized, inclusive, and transparent organization would be much better aligned with the needs of the everyday person.

As of now, you probably have a lot of questions about MoonDAO‚Ä¶ Maybe even as basic as ‚ÄúWhat in the _galaxy_ is a DAO?‚Äù And we promise to get you up to warp speed on all that through these emails.

But first and foremost, you should know that a DAO is a sort of choose-your-own-adventure organization‚Ä¶ A bottom-up, member-led community that can be as involved, ambitious, or idealistic as YOU and our members make it.

## üöÄ Today‚Äôs Moon Mission

Speaking of choose-your-own-adventure, your FIRST mission as a new MoonDAO Earthling is to let us know what your level of experience is with DAOs and Web3 so we can customize the next emails to your needs.

**Please click** **ONE** **button** that best describes your current knowledge and experience with DAOs and Web3:

[New to Web3](https://www.moondao.com/thank-you#explorer)

[Active Web3 User](https://www.moondao.com/thank-you#contributor)

To be clear, **New to Web3** will guide you through a training camp on the basics of Web3 and everything you need to participate while **Active Web3 User** means you should already have an account on a centralized exchange, have a browser wallet (and know how to use it), be familiar with Ethereum, know how to use a DEX, and so forth‚Ä¶ If you don‚Äôt know those things or don‚Äôt even know what Web3 is, then be sure to click New to Web3.

No matter which one you pick, our goal is to guide you from Earthling to Moon Settler (and beyond) over the course of these emails. MoonDAO‚Äôs mission in space is an ambitious goal and we‚Äôll need you (and many others!) on board as we strive to create open and inclusive access to outer space for all Earthlings.

You can expect regular emails during your training period as we get you onboarded and up to speed. These emails will often contain a Moon Mission or homework assignment that you should try and complete in a timely manner to be able to continue with the next Moon Mission (some are essential to advance).

**Today‚Äôs Moon Mission is easy. Just click above on the one item that best describes your current experience with Web3 ‚Äì don‚Äôt skip that!**

More to come in our next email, Earthling.
