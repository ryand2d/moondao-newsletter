Hey {{ subscriber.first_name | strip | default: "Earthling" }},

Welcome to Day 5 out of 7 of your MoonDAO onboarding. MoonDAO started as a meme… Yes, a joke. When all this initially began, there were no grand plans about sending regular people into space or envisioning a settlement on the Moon. In order to understand MoonDAO and where we are going, it helps to understand where we came from, and to illustrate the idea and ideal that a DAO is a living organism that evolves and changes over time.

MoonDAO was born out of the ashes of ConstitutionDAO, a project which aimed to crowdfund enough money to buy an original copy of the U.S. Constitution that was coming up for auction. ConstitutionDAO raised more than $47 million from contributors all over the world but was ultimately outbid by a famous billionaire investor – one rich individual who defeated the collective wishes and desires of more than 17,000 people who financially supported the movement.

That failed effort gave birth to a similar idea about buying the largest lunar asteroid that was coming up for auction at Christie’s. We would crowdraise the funds to win this less-competitive auction and we would _buy the Moon_, one rock at a time – that was the joke.

But that wacky idea led to something a little more serious when someone suggested that we could make a much bigger mark by raising funds to send someone to space – a regular person rather than another rich billionaire or those lucky enough to get selected by governments.

Space exploration is the one thing that could and _should_ unite humanity. The first space race pitted nations against each other, and now we are in a private space race with companies pitted against each other. But Web3 has the tools to unite humanity around common causes, and space represents probably the biggest economic opportunity of our lifetimes. We believe in borderless, permissionless access to the cosmos for everyone, regardless of nationality, race, or personal riches.

That’s the real heart and ethos of MoonDAO – it’s a place to give voice to the space dreams and goals of the many in this exciting new era of space exploration and ensure that it isn’t the exclusive domain of the rich and the few.

## The Birth of MoonDAO

Once that seed of sending someone to space was planted, MoonDAO set out to make it a reality with a fundraising goal of $450,000 which had been advertised as the price for one seat by Virgin Galactic on a sub-orbital flight.

On December 17th, 2021, the fundraising initiative was launched on the [​Juicebox platform​](https://juicebox.money/p/moondao) where anyone around the world could donate ETH toward the mission in exchange for MOONEY. For every 1 ETH in donations, one million MOONEY would be minted with half going to the donors and the other half retained in the MoonDAO treasury toward future projects.

MoonDAO was designed to be equitable and fair from the beginning, meaning that there was no pre-mining, no favorable terms for founders, friends, or family, nor was there any venture capital money invested. It was created to be a bottom-up community of regular people around the world who dream of space exploration becoming a reality in _this_ lifetime.

You can [​read more about the MOONEY tokenomics​](https://docs.moondao.com/token/), but the TLDR version is that no additional MOONEY can be minted (there will only ever be 2.6 billion), there was no prerelease of tokens, everyone got the same terms, and 50% was held in the treasury for future projects.

After one lunar cycle (28 days), the fundraising period ended with more than 2,600 ETH (over $8 million USD) donated by more than 2,000 individuals. Enough to send at least one person to sub-orbital space and far above the original goal! It was also clear evidence that this was a mission that ignited the imaginations of so many around the world, and which spread basically by word-of-mouth on the Internet.

## Ticket to Space

With the completion of Phase 1 and the creation of the MOONEY governance token, the next step was to deliver on our goal of sending someone into space. A member of MoonDAO had connections to Blue Origin and thanks to the wildly successful initial fundraising, it was decided that we would send not one but TWO regular people to space – the first would be a popular content creator chosen by community vote and another would be randomly chosen via a free [​Ticket to Space NFT​](https://docs.moondao.com/nft-faqs/) that was open to all.

Less than six months after fundraising concluded, the community voted to send a member of the popular YouTube channel Dude Perfect to sub-orbital space. The members of Dude Perfect conducted their own internal contest – [​an epic model rocket launch challenge​](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=venrE8gdz30) – to see which of them would get to ride on the real thing, and Coby Cotton came out victorious!

Coby was aboard Blue Origin’s NS-22 which launched out of West Texas less than two months after being chosen by the community.

If you haven’t seen it yet, be sure to [​watch Dude Perfect’s incredible video of the launch​](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXXlSG-du7c) – it might just bring a tear to your eye. These are the types of experiences we want for more regular people from all walks of life.

So, that’s exactly what we did… With a verifiably random drawing thanks to blockchain technology and transparency, Yan KeJun won the free Ticket to Space raffle. Yan isn’t a billionaire or a popular social media star, he’s just a regular father of three from China who entered the contest never imagining that he would win, and not even sure if MoonDAO was legit and would actually make this happen.

Yan experienced some delays for his launch due to visa issues and other logistical matters, but things are in motion and his launch date is quickly approaching, so keep an eye out for that as we continue to make history together… The first DAO to send not just one person to space, but two – with hopefully many more to come.

## Going Forward

Our Phase 2 mission was to send someone to space, which we accomplished in a remarkably quick time, and now our efforts shift to focusing on funding space research and exploration with the funds remaining after purchasing two Tickets to Space from the initial fundraiser.

Since then, we have sent MoonDAO members to the International Astronautical Congress (the world’s largest space conference), sponsored fellowships with the Open Lunar Foundation, and set the stage for decentralized governance with the enactment of our constitution and innovative mechanisms like stake-to-vote and welcomed thousands more to our open community, including you.

That’s our history in brief, but our future will be shaped by YOU and the community. As an open, bottom-up organization, all the things we do are made possible by the efforts and ideas of passionate individuals working toward the greater common good and making humanity multi-planetary.

There are lots of interesting projects in the works including the launch of a MoonDAO decentralized satellite, placing a crypto bounty physically on the Moon as a prize for humanity’s return, brewing Space Beer with yeast sent into orbit, zero gravity flights, potential future launches to low-earth orbit or to the moon, and much more.

The projects of tomorrow will need your brain power, time, expertise, and passion. Everything MoonDAO has done so far has been thanks to the contributions of regular, everyday people, striving to open space for all and do big things together. In our next email, we will go into specifics about the ways that you can get involved with MoonDAO by completing tasks, contributing to projects, or even leading your own.
