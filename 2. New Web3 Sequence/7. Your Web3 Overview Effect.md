Congratulations Cadet!

Welcome to your final day of Web3 onboarding! We have covered a lot during Phase 1 of your training missions and youâ€™ve come a long way since we began. If youâ€™ve been diligently following along and completing your Moon Missions, you already know more about the Web3 space than the vast majority of people on Earth. You should feel proud!

Letâ€™s recap a little bit of what weâ€™ve covered over the past week or so:

- The basics of Web3 and how it differs from earlier Web1 and Web2 spaces.
- An intro to Ethereum and how it serves as the rocket fuel to power Web3â€™s distributed computer system.
- Buying ETH on a centralized exchange like Coinbase.
- What DAOs are, how they are governed, and some of their pros and cons.
- Setting up a browser wallet like MetaMask to interact with Web3.
- Some of the VERY important security precautions you should take to stay safe, and avoid scams, phishing, and other bad actors.
- Transferring ETH to your browser wallet.
- Swapping ETH for MOONEY governance tokens using Uniswap.

Itâ€™s a lot to absorb, so donâ€™t feel dissuaded if you donâ€™t understand everything at this point in time and still feel a little lost in the Web3 space.

In reality, the best way to learn about DAOs and Web3 is by DOING.

Right now, youâ€™ve got all the basic tools to become a DAO contributor, so during Phase 2 of your training we will be going into more detail about MoonDAO, how we operate, and how YOU can become more involved whether that means just staying informed about what weâ€™re doing, voting on proposals and contributing to governance, or putting forward your own projects and proposals, or even becoming a full-time MoonDAO contributor.

But we've got one more mission for you...
