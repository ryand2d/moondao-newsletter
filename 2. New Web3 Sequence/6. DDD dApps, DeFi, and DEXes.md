Hey {{ subscriber.first_name | strip | default: "Earthling" }},

Welcome to Day 6 out of 7 of your Web3 onboarding. Last time we talked about security and how important it is to do your DD (due diligence) whenever interacting in the crypto space, but this time we are going to throw another D on that acronym and talk about DDD: dApps, DeFi, and DEXes.

In case you haven‚Äôt picked up on the pattern in Web3, the D or De in any acronym almost always stands for decentralized. You already know about DAOs, but we also have dApps: decentralized applications, DeFi: decentralized finance, and DEXes: decentralized exchanges. All of these are built on the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts without middlemen to create trust-free systems that anyone with a bit of ETH can interact with to do many incredible things.

## Decentralized Finance

DeFi was one of the first big ‚Äúkiller apps‚Äù on Ethereum. Just as opening a wallet and holding your own funds was like you becoming the bank, this means that you can perform some of the same functions a traditional bank might do and get rewarded for doing so. This includes supplying funds to liquidity pools, earning interest, loaning out your assets, and much more ‚Äì all controlled by smart contracts and computer code.

On the flip side, you can also be a customer in the DeFi world. You don‚Äôt need a bank to loan you money, you could take out a USD stablecoin loan against your assets with no one to negotiate rates with or deny you. You don‚Äôt need to fill out an application or wait two weeks for a response as they do a credit check‚Ä¶ Since they are overcollateralized loans, you can click a few buttons and receive a loan in USD straight to your wallet in minutes.

Decentralized Exchanges (or DEXes) are similar to Centralized Exchanges like Coinbase where you can easily buy tokens or swap between crypto assets, but this time there is no middleman. The main advantage of a Centralized Exchange is that it allows us to connect a bank account and turn fiat currency into cryptocurrency (and vice versa), something that a DEX is not yet able to do.

Regardless of your plans to swap currencies or utilize a DEX, we always recommend self-custody of your funds in your own wallet. On a Centralized Exchange (CEX), they could lock you out of your account, restrict it, or otherwise prevent you from accessing your money if you have done something they find objectionable or against their terms of service. More than one CEX has got out of business completely over the years, taking its customers down with them. It doesn‚Äôt happen often, but it has happened.

With a DEX, there is no risk of that. There are no gatekeepers or people to say ‚Äòno‚Äô to you. Once you have some ETH in your MetaMask wallet, you can interact with all the dApps you like and the entire Web3 ecosystem opens up to you, not just MoonDAO.

## üöÄ Today‚Äôs Moon Mission

There is a lot of interesting stuff happening in the DeFi space, but that goes well beyond the scope of our focus here. We will be utilizing a DEX, however, so you can swap or exchange some of your funds for MOONEY, our governance token, which will officially mark your entrance into MoonDAO, and today‚Äôs Moon Mission marks your first real initiation into Web3!

**REMEMBER:** MOONEY is strictly a governance token that does not represent fractionalized ownership and there is no expectation of profit.

Swapping ETH for MOONEY will require a few steps but you should be able to complete everything relatively quickly even if this is all new to you.

**1. Transfer ETH to MetaMask**

Your first step is to log in to the CEX where you initially purchased ETH, whether that is Coinbase, Binance, or another exchange. Each platform is slightly different, but typically you will need to click on Ethereum in your asset balance, click wallet, and click the tab to send/receive ETH.

[‚ÄãHow to Send/Receive from Coinbase‚Äã](https://help.coinbase.com/en-in/coinbase/trading-and-funding/sending-or-receiving-cryptocurrency/how-to-send-and-receive-cryptocurrency)

Confirm which asset or network you are trying to send from or pay with (Ethereum, in our case), and choose how much you want to send. If it is a small amount as we recommended, you can choose to send the max amount, but if it is a large amount of money or you are nervous about your first withdrawal, you can start with a much smaller amount to test it.

You will see the ‚ÄúTo:‚Äù space for where you want to send funds. Here is where you will use your MetaMask public address. Sign in to the MetaMask browser wallet and copy your address to the clipboard ‚Äì it is that long chain of letters and numbers beginning with 0x. Paste your MetaMask address into the ‚ÄúTo:‚Äù field in Coinbase.

**IMPORTANT:** Get into the habit of double-checking the address before confirming a transaction or pressing send! You can check letter-by-letter if you like, but always check the first and last four or five digits to ensure what you copy-and-pasted matches your actual MetaMask address. In the future, you can save this withdrawal address to your whitelist or allowlist that will permit transactions only to this address, which is a handy security feature.

Within a matter of minutes, you will see your new balance reflected in MetaMask! Congratulations, you have officially taken custody of your funds and are free to interact in Web3.

If you did a test transfer to start, repeat the process above to transfer the full amount. You will need enough ETH to swap a portion for MOONEY as well as extra to pay for gas fees (the transaction fees to operate on the Ethereum network).

**2. Use Uniswap to Get MOONEY**

Uniswap is an open-source, decentralized exchange (DEX) that is not controlled by any single entity and is run entirely by smart contracts. Uniswap is the largest DEX in operation and has spawned numerous offshoots thanks to the open-source nature of the project.

Here is where you can swap your ETH to MOONEY, our governance token, along with an almost overwhelming number of other tokens, the vast majority of which you‚Äôve never heard of.

Visit [‚Äãuniswap.org‚Äã](https://www.uniswap.org) and click on ‚ÄúLaunch App‚Äù in the corner.

In the corner, you will click ‚ÄúConnect Wallet‚Äù and select MetaMask or whichever wallet you are using to hold your ETH.

![Uniswap interface showing amounts, gas fee, and wallet connection..](https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/5MgHd6kkhZ8fZBAgpuZgWA/61ohjYg7MdRoC6zehGLESC/email)

In the Swap menu, you will see ETH -> Select Token where you will want to search for MOONEY from MoonDAO or you can paste in the token address:

0x20d4DB1946859E2Adb0e5ACC2eac58047aD41395

Be sure to confirm the token address ‚Äì you can also skip some of these steps by [‚Äãusing this link to swap ETH/MOONEY on Uniswap‚Äã](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=ETH&outputCurrency=0x20d4DB1946859E2Adb0e5ACC2eac58047aD41395&chain=mainnet) but we think it is important to learn step-by-step and confirm what you are doing.

Select how much ETH you want to convert to MOONEY. Do not convert all of your ETH because you will need to pay gas fees, both for this transaction and future transactions, so we recommend setting aside at least $25 USD in ETH for now. The amount you wish to convert to MOONEY is up to you and any amount is fine to start with MoonDAO.

At the bottom right corner, you will see an estimated price for gas fees.

Click the swap button and your MetaMask wallet will pop up asking you to sign and confirm the transaction. If everything looks good, click to confirm in MetaMask. Within a few minutes, the MOONEY tokens will appear in your wallet!

**üéâ Welcome to MoonDAO! üéâ**

If the transaction was successful and the [‚Äãtokens still haven't appeared in MetaMask‚Äã](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489031-How-to-display-tokens-in-MetaMask), click refresh list or import tokens > custom token and paste the MOONEY token address 0x20d4DB1946859E2Adb0e5ACC2eac58047aD41395 to add to your wallet.

	That‚Äôs all there is to using a DEX to exchange funds and obtain MOONEY. While some of the steps might have seemed overwhelming or foreign, you have officially entered the Web3 space, taken self-custody of your assets, used a DeFi protocol, and joined MoonDAO! That‚Äôs _one giant leap_ for most people.

If you have any problems or questions about this process, be sure to [‚Äãjoin the MoonDAO Discord‚Äã](https://www.moondao.com/discord) and ask for help in the Support Channel. You can also read more [‚Äãdetails about the MOONEY token under MoonDAO‚Äôs Documentation‚Äã](https://docs.moondao.com/token/).
